# This code will read in precipitation data and find storms.
#For those storms it will give these outputs:
#    mustormlength (days)
#    mustormdepth (mm)
#    muinterestorm (days)

#for HP could test this threshold by varrying it and calculating some statistics
#currenlty missing 15 (for 1999) days where rain >0 but <preciptocountasstorm
#does not take into account storms that go over the new year
#could add some bash scripting to format precip data.
#currently needs a single column tab-separated .txt of precip in mm
